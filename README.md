# Product Care Group - Mailing List Subscription Task

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## List of concerns
1. The API will respond status 200 when entering a non-email value.

2. The API will respond status 200 when entering any value on "name", "phone" and "postcode". For example, "ABC" for phone number or any random postcode that is not a valid UK postcode.

3. Unsubscrible option is not available

4. In the current version of app, a user must enter his/her additional information immediately after he/she has successfully subscribed the mailing list. He/she could not come back to the site to provide additional information.

5. The "sourceRef" is likely to be an API key and must be hidden using environment variables (dotenv).

6. Given time constraint, a thorough testing is not possible in this project

7. Given time constraint, semantic HTML and Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is not possible in this project

8. Given time constraint, a proper CSS styling and dynamic CSS styling is not possible in this project
